### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Abdul Alim
#### Web developer and app developer

I'm Mohammad Abdul alim. Since my childhood I wanted to be a developer . So that I can present something new to people . Which people will be very impressed with . My desire to become a developer started when I saw a mobile app. I was very surprised and wondered how it was made. Then after many attempts I found out that behind the side we are seeing is a huge coding ocean and by coding a website and mobile app is designed . And through it works.
From that source I learned this coding today.
Thanks for taking the time to read.
